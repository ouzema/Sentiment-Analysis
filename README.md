# **Sentiment Analysis of Google Play Store Apps Reviews**

In this project we are going to :
*   Understand the theory behind sentiment analysis, including feature extraction from text (bag-of-words), and tokenizing\
    text (count vectorizer and term frequency-inverse document frequency)
*   Explore the Yelp Business Reviews dataset to perform text cleaning and vectorization
*   Build Word Count and Word Cloud plots to extract some meaning from the sentiments
*   Create a model to classify positive and negative reviews with Multinomial Naive Bayes Classifier, which is frequently used in the Natural Language Processing, as well as test your predictions
